- The project is created using react. I have used javascript and typescript in  this project.
- It contains 5 draggable components named from A to E.
- These components can be dragged and dropped between 2 groups. 
- Currently these are hardcoded but can be changed and we can increase the number of groups or elements as we please.
- The elements can also be reshaped in the bottom direction towards any side. 
- We can change this too and can add more directions from which the element can be resized.

below images are part of the implementation of the project:
